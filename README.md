This is a calculator project for learning C#, I may add advance feature (or normal) in it in future.
Currently, it just gets the Principal, rate and time from the user and the gives the simple interest on it and then it adds the Principal and the SI.
And sadly, it doesn't calculates big numbers (like, 5454542313) right.
So it may give you wrong output.
This calculator can give decimal outputs but can't take decimal inputs, so if you try this please keep that in mind.
This may become my main future project.
Okay so now it can give you the Compounded interest, just be sure to not put decimal numbers anywhere yet.
